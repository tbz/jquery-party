- selector should only match ONE element
- All images in selector have to have the same size (we use the first image's dimensions)
- No options are required.

<script>
$(selector).party({
	// Gutter in pixels
	"gutter"			: 10, 
	// Images per page
	"perPage"			:  2,
	// How fast the slide should go (ms or jQuery speed name)
	"duration"			: "normal"
});
</script>
